// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.// give it a name:int led = 13;// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:void setup() {  // initialize the digital pin as an output.  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);  digitalWrite(led, LOW);   // set initial LED condition to off  Serial.begin(9600);  Serial.println("Enter 1 to turn the led on & enter 0 to turn off.");}// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:void loop() {  if ( Serial.available() )  {    int ledControl = Serial.read();    Serial.println(ledControl);        if ( ledControl == 48 ) //0 is 48 in ASCII    { digitalWrite(led, LOW);    	Serial.print("Led on pin 13 is off.");    }    if ( ledControl == 49 ) //1 is 49 in ASCII    {       Serial.print("Led on pin 13 is now on.");      digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  }  }}
